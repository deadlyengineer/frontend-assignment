As a user, you're able to:

- See the list of collectibles you and your friends own
- Filter collectibles you own
- Sort by price or most recent acquired
- Search by keyword

Figma is [here](https://www.figma.com/file/0u4WnFXeOBzR8I3tEcG393/Frontend-Assignment).

We understand this design can take a meaningful amount of time to be implemented. If time is a constraint, focus on areas where you can really showcase your skills. Are you a CSS guru? Show us what you can do. If you prefer to work "under the hood", how do you handle the user actions and optimize the page to allow Pods to contain thousands of collectibles?

You're welcome to use libraries that could help you with this task. Also, feel free to modify any aspect of the code if you think that will make it better.

The data is being provided by [React Query](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com) in combination with a [Mock Server](https://mswjs.io). The mocked responses can be modified [here](https://github.com/pullidea-dev/frontend-assignment/blob/main/src/mocks/handlers/pod.ts).
